# ZI-ISAG
 ZI-ISAG is an internet search augmented generation paradigm for LLMs. Key features include:
 - Dynamically integrate the latest online information (without maintaining any index for any fixed corpus).
 - The core technical component is an extractor LLM (i.e., Yi-9B-Ext) which can accurately and efficiently extract relevant information from the fresh content.
 - Yi-9B-Ext only outputs the associated TAGs of the relevant information in the tagged content, significantly improving efficiency of the extraction process.
