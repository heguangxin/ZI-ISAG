# ZI-ISAG
 ZI-ISAG is an internet search augmented generation paradigm for LLMs. Key features include:
 - Dynamically integrate the latest online information (without maintaining any index for any fixed corpus).
 - The core component is an extractor LLM which can accurately and efficiently extract relevant information from the tagged content.
 - Extractor LLM only outputs the associated TAGs in the tagged content, significantly improving efficiency of the extraction process.
