However, there are slight differences in their approach.\n\nAssistant A's response was concise and to the point, simply stating \"response example.\" This is minimalistic and does not provide any additional context or information.\n\nAssistant B's response, while still a placeholder, added a bit more context by stating, \"response example, this is a response example that a LLM may generate.\" This additional sentence, although still not providing a concrete example, gives a bit more insight into the nature of the response.\n\nGiven that both responses are placeholders and do not fulfill the user's request for an example, the evaluation must consider the slight additional context provided by Assistant B.\n\nTherefore, based on the minimal additional context provided by Assistant B, the verdict is:\n\n[[B]]"]}
