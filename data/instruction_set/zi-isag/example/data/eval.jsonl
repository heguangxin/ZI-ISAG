{"prompt": "<|im_start|>user\nYour task is to filter and extract the relevant information and corresponding tags from the #Reference Materials#. The extracted information will be included as reference content in a prompt given to a generative AI. This generative AI will use this prompt in a downstream task to generate a response to the #User Query#. Although your task does not include generating the response to the #User Query#, you must ensure the completeness, richness, and accuracy of the information you extract to guarantee that the generative AI in the downstream task has rich, complete, and accurate relevant information when generating the response to the #User Query#.\nThe content of the #Reference Materials# provided is enclosed within the tags <Reference Materials> and </Reference Materials>, while the content of the #User Query# is enclosed within the tags <User Query> and </User Query>. The #Reference Materials# are divided into multiple segments, with each segment's content enclosed within its corresponding tags. For example, the content of the i-th segment is enclosed within the tags <T-i> and </T-i>.\n\n#Reference Materials#:<Reference Materials><T-1>Top 3 Recommended Smart Door Locks of 2024\nXiaomi Door Lock\nPriced at 799 yuan, this door lock is highly cost-effective and considered a disruptor in the industry.</T-1><T-2> It's the cheapest Xiaomi door lock to date.</T-2><T-3> The product supports multiple unlocking methods and uses a C-level direct-insertion lock cylinder with a three-proof smart lock body, ensuring home security.</T-3><T-4> The handle integrates a high-security 'integrated semiconductor fingerprint recognition module,' which can accurately identify fingerprint information.</T-4><T-5> When pressing down the handle, the door can be unlocked simultaneously, with a fingerprint recognition rate of 99%, and it can recognize fingerprints within 0.5 seconds.</T-5><T-6> The door lock also integrates a smart doorbell, which will ring on both the interior and exterior panels when a visitor presses the doorbell, and the Mijia App will send a notification to your smartphone.</T-6><T-7> It also supports Xiaomi's smart ecosystem, allowing you to close smart appliances, turn off fans, and start the robot vacuum by pressing the defense button on the outer door lock panel when leaving home.</T-7><T-8>\nQin General Smart Door Lock Q14\nThe Qin General Q14 is first noted for its affordable price, with many models priced under 1,000 yuan, yet it doesn't compromise on functionality.</T-8><T-9> It supports fingerprint, password, key, and card unlocking, as well as remote smartphone unlocking.</T-9><T-10> Qin General is a well-known brand in China, recognized for its reliable product quality and after-sales service.</T-10><T-11> Both the lock body and panel are made of stainless steel, ensuring strong durability.</T-11><T-12> The Qin General fingerprint lock uses imported chips and sensors to guarantee product stability and reliability.</T-12><T-13> Additionally, it has anti-pry, anti-drill, and anti-technical unlocking features, enhancing the product's security.</T-13><T-14>\nDesmann V9\nDesmann is a leading brand in the domestic smart lock industry, comparable to Kaadas, and has grown alongside the ten-year golden development period of smart locks in China.</T-14><T-15> Desmann primarily uses chips imported from Germany and the United States in their products, and the V9 model is equipped with a German Hiyie high-definition fingerprint algorithm chip and world-leading ACAM protection technology.</T-15><T-16> The Desmann V9 is a high-end model in their semi-automatic smart lock lineup and the only one with a visual peephole, making it a great choice for users with a sufficient budget.</T-16></Reference Materials>\n\n#User Query#:<User Query>How is the Huawei smart door lock?</User Query>\n\nPlease extract information from the #Reference Materials# based on the #User Query# by following these steps:\n1. Filter out content in the #Reference Materials# that is irrelevant or weakly related to the #User Query#.\n2. Extract all relevant information and their corresponding tags from the #Reference Materials# needed to generate a response to the #User Query#, with a primary focus on highly relevant information\n\nReturn the result in the following format: '#Extracted Information#:1.___[<T-i>, ...]\n2.___[<T-j>, <T-k>~<T-k+m>, <T-n>]\n...'. Output the key content of each piece of information that meets the extraction requirements (keep the key content concise and ensure completeness of each extracted piece of information), and note the associated tags in brackets [].(A piece of information may contain multiple segments and therefore may be associated with multiple tags.)\n\nAttention Points:\n- If a group of output tags contains consecutive labels, connect the first and last tags in the group with a '~' symbol.\n- If there are multiple pieces of effective information in the #Reference Materials# with similar key content, do not de-duplicate. Extract all such information and their tag sets and merge them into one combined piece of information and one combined tag set. Ensure that the combined tag set still includes all the tags associated with the original information before merging.\n- For multi-hop reasoning, extract and retain all information and their tags needed in the reasoning process.\n- If no relevant information is extracted, output '#Extracted Information#:None'.\n- The language of the extracted information should be consistent with the original text in the #Reference Materials#.<|im_end|>\n", "chosen": "<|im_start|>assistant\n['#Extracted Information#: None']<|im_end|>\n"}
